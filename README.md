# Lyrics

This Rainmeter skin will search for the WebNowPlaying plugin detected song's lyrics on the MusixMatch website and display them in an auto-scrolling window. To get Spotify working with this, get Spicetify.

# Installation
路 **Install Rainmeter**.
路 **Install and setup Spicetify** *(if you modify it to use another music plugin, please let me know. It's easy, but Spotify is what I use)*.
路 **Install WebNowPlaying Rainmeter plugin**.
路 **Clone this repository and extract it with the rest of your skins**.
